## Welcome to my User Page
I am a third year Math - CS student at UC San Diego. I am an international student from [Mumbai](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/mumbai). Studying in California was a dream for me ever since my sister went to a UC school. This is me living _my dream life_. 

## Academic Background
### Context 
> I started coding as a class requirement in 8th grade but now I choose to take college CS classes so I guess I really do like it :P

My first ever program was `System.out.println("Hello World");` and now I'm out here studying how to make a difference in the world with my program. 

### Experience 
- Resident Assistant at Sixth College
- CSE Tutor for CSE 15L with Joe Politz
- Software Engineer Intern last Summer at Edelweiss, Mumbai.
- Personal projects using Python, Java, C++.

### Things I want to achieve before graduating from UCSD
* [ ] Get a job I truly enjoy
* [ ] Get Research Experience
* [ ] Eat at every dining hall at least once
* [x] Get internship experience
* [ ] Go visit the Fallen Star

## Personal Background 
> I **LOVE** travelling and photography.
